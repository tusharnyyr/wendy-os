# Wendy OS  
### Event-Driven AI Productivity Operating System

Wendy OS is a modular, backend-first AI system designed to log activity, analyze behavioral patterns, generate weekly summaries, detect productivity drift, and trigger automation workflows.

This is not a chatbot.

It is a structured intelligence engine built with separation of concerns, deterministic routing, and event-driven architecture.

## 🧠 Core Architecture

Telegram → n8n → FastAPI Backend → PostgreSQL → Event Bus → n8n → Telegram

The backend is responsible for:
- Intent parsing
- Activity logging
- Analytics computation
- Drift detection
- Suggestion generation
- Event emission

Automation is handled independently through n8n webhooks.

This ensures transport-agnostic and modular design.
